# Keras_multi_classifier

## Summary

The goal of this project was to implement a multi-classifier using a convolutional neural network and the MNIST dataset.

The baseline for comparison is a dense feed-forward classifier built on the same data which received an accuracy of 97.8%, used as an example in [Chollet: Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition), chapter 2. My model reached accuracy of 99.01%
